# AntiMuckBot
An Anti-Muck bot made for r/DaniDev to stop the muck chains (or die trying). Very much inspired by [u/Hananelroe's bot](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hananelroe), so thanks bro!

# Prerequisites 
1. Python3
2. Colorams
3. Praw
4. ...That's it

# How to run
1. Fill out the `topSecretInfo.py` needed info. You need a bit of knowledge (or google) to get some of the required stuff.
2. Run `AntiMuckBot.py` script. Open a terminal in the same directory of the script and run `python3 AntiMuckBot.py`. 
3. It should give you your username, and the subreddit you decided to destroy.
